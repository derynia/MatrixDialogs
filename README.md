Matrix Dialogs

Pet project.
Matrix dialogs is a part language learning method proposed by the Nikolai Zamyatkin. 
The method is - listening to short dialogues (aprox. 1 min. long). For about 20 times for on dialogue in a cycle.
The dialogue must not contain any addition sounds. Only text, pronounced by speakers.
I tried this method on me and found it quite useful. 
Yet I also found that just listening is not too helpful. 
You should have three pieces for succesfull listening:
    - audio file of recorded dialogue (this is the most important)
    - text of the dialogue in language you're learning
    - translation of thois text to your language.

This application helps to bring all these pieces together.
